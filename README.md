ELO-AutoIt-scripts
==================

[AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) scripts for [ISU ELO](http://www.elo.iastate.edu/101/) classrooms.

### Setup

* Install [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) on the encoder computer if it's not already installed.
* Download these script files.  AutoIt scripts end with .au3 extension.
* Edit the `passwords.au3` file and set the appropriate passwords.
* Create a shortcut to the `start.au3` file and put it someplace easy to access like the desktop.
* Open up the `start.au3` script and look at the top of the file.  This has the parameters that need to be passed into the script.
* Edit the shortcut and enter the appropriate parameter values at the end of the target line.
* Run the shortcut and enjoy the automated startup! :)
